3. What are the order ids of the orders that ordered "Sasquatch Ale"? HINT:
Find the product id of "Sasquatch Ale" in a subquery and then use that
value to find the matching orders from the `order details` table. Because
the `order details` table has a space in its name, you will need to surround
it with back ticks in the FROM clause.
